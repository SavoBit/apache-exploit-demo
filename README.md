# apache-exploit

Apache exploit is a simple demonstration of the apache struts vulnerability
(CVE-2017-9805) inside a single Kubernetes namespace. There are no external
dependencies other then the cluster DNS. The purpose of running inside a
Kubernetes namespace is simplicity. This demo is intended to show how
Aporto protects from the Apache Struts vulnerability and is not intended to
demonstrate a real Kubernetes application.

## Components

There are three components each corresponding to a single container.

- Server is a apache struts server with the vulnerability
- Client represents an external attacker
- Controller represents an external control system under control of the attacker

The attack chain is as follows
- The Client connects to the Server
- The Client causes the Server to execute a command
- The Server connects to the attackers Controller
